Task 1: Data Collection and Web  Scraping
ðŸ“˜ Project Title: Book Data Scraper using Python
Description:

I developed a Python-based web scraping script to extract book data from the website Books to Scrape.

The script performs the following tasks:

Fetches and parses the HTML content of the website using requests and BeautifulSoup.

Extracts key information such as Book Title, Price, and Rating from each book listed.

Automatically navigates through multiple pages using pagination handling.

Stores the scraped data into a structured CSV file using pandas.

This project demonstrates practical web scraping techniques, data extraction from HTML elements, and basic data storage in CSV format â€” a foundational skill for any data science role.
